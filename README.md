## Data Engineering
### Data Warehousing
**1. [Kimball's Data Warehouse Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-1gvleB9G-csHTTwjeQ5Ac_-P3Wr2Cd/view?usp=sharing)**

Toolkit of dimensional design principles and techniques. This book contains many examples that serve as a framework to discuss the patterns that
emerge in dimensional modeling. It is mainly used as a quality reference when designing **Data Warehouses**

**2. [Data Warehouse Fundamentals Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-warehouse-fundamentals-for-beginners/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=GjbDpcHcs4w&ranSiteID=GjbDpcHcs4w-Z4loChyTwoEeSbWrJLz3Jw&utm_source=aff-campaign&LSNPUBID=GjbDpcHcs4w&utm_medium=udemyads)**

A Udemy course I have completed to get a solid grasp of Data Warehousing fundamentals.

### Data modeling
**1. [Data modeling for Power BI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrLnibFTtbA)**

The main topics that are discussed in the video include: Data modeling (more specifically, dimensional modeling), the attributes of a good data model (what makes a good data model), the advantages of a good data model, star schemas, Fact (the representation of a business event, for example a sale transaction, a student enrolling in a course, ...) and Dimension (contains descriptive attributes that define how a fact should roll up, for example, rol it up to the country, to the category, ...) tables, the granurality of data, ...

The video also includes a demo.

### ETL and ELT
### SQL
### APIs

## Data Analysis / Data Science
**1. Statistics**

- [Descriptive Statistics](DescriptiveStatistics.MD)
- [Confidence Interval and Sampling Strategies]()

**2. Data visualization**
- [10 Rules For Better Dashboard Design](https://uxplanet.org/10-rules-for-better-dashboard-design-ef68189d734c)

## Markdown
